  Abstract                 = {We present a comprehensive study of a class of multiband miniaturized patch antennas designed for use in a 3-D enclosed sensor array for microwave breast imaging. Miniaturization and multiband operation are achieved by loading the antenna with nonradiating slots at strategic locations along the patch. This results in symmetric radiation patterns and similar radiation characteristics at all frequencies of operation. Prototypes were fabricated and tested in a biocompatible immersion medium. Excellent agreement was obtained between simulations and measurements. The tradeoff between miniaturization and radiation efficiency within this class of patch antennas is explored via a numerical analysis of the effects of the location and number of slots, as well as the thickness and permittivity of the dielectric substrate, on the resonant frequencies and gain. Additionally, we compare 3-D quantitative microwave breast imaging performance achieved with two different enclosed arrays of slot-loaded miniaturized patch antennas. Simulated array measurements were obtained for a 3-D anatomically realistic numerical breast phantom. The reconstructed breast images generated from miniaturized patch array data suggest that, for the realistic noise power levels assumed in this study, the variations in gain observed across this class of multiband patch antennas do not significantly impact the overall image quality. We conclude that these miniaturized antennas are promising candidates as compact array elements for shielded, multifrequency microwave breast imaging systems.},

Harmonic rejection in the antenna has been achieved at its feed level using highly compact design of defected ground structure (DGS). Rejection characteristics have been improved adding an open stub to the feed line. All possible higher order modes occurring in between the fundamental and the 3rd harmonic have been identified. Relative suppression of radiated fields with and without DGS-control has been quantitatively measured and effective control of harmonics has been experimentally ensured. The area occupied by the proposed DGS has been compared with earlier designs and over 40-90% reduction in size has been documented.},

With the coupling feed, which effectively compensates for the large inductive reactance of the antenna, a dual-resonance excitation for the antenna's lower band at about 1 GHz is achieved; the obtained bandwidth reaches 500 MHz, allowing the antenna to easily cover GSM850/900 operation. Also, a wide operating band is achieved for the antenna's upper band at about 1.9 GHz with a bandwidth of 540 MHz, hence easily covering GSM1800/1900/UMTS operation. With two wide operating bands achieved, the antenna occupies a thickness of 5 mm only and a small area of 9 x 79 mm(2) (not including the ground plane), making it very promising to be embedded inside the casing of the laptop computer as an internal WWAN antenna. The proposed antenna is studied in detail in this study.},

The design procedure follows the circuit approach-synthesis of bandpass filters. The filtering antenna has two poles in the passband and two radiation nulls (zeros) at the band edges. Compared to the conventional patch antenna, the proposed filtering antenna, with little extra circuit area, has flat gain response within the passband, good selectivity at the passband edge and wider bandwidth. Measurement results show that the filtering antenna can operate at 5.29 GHz, has a 430 MHz bandwidth and a 2.5 dBi antenna gain in the broadside (+Z) direction within the passband.},

The antenna occupies a compact area of 15 x 50 mm(2) only, yet generating three resonant modes to form two wide bands at about 900 and 1800 MHz for the Global System for Mobile Communication/Digital Communication System operation. Detailed design considerations of the three excited modes are described in the paper. When a shielding metal case is placed close to the antenna, small effects on the antenna's impedance matching are seen, allowing compact integration of the antenna with nearby conducting elements or electronic components. The antenna is also found to result in small excited surface current distributions on the system ground plane of the mobile phone. This behavior is expected to lead to reduced user's hand effects on the radiation efficiency of the antenna.},

  Abstract                 = {Synthesis and design of a new printed filtering antenna is presented in this communication. For the requirements of efficient integration and simple fabrication, the co-design approach for the integration of filter and antenna is introduced. The printed inverted-L antenna and the parallel coupled microstrip line sections are used for example to illustrate the synthesis of a bandpass filtering antenna. The equivalent circuit model for the inverted-L antenna, which is mainly a series RLC circuit, is first established. The values of the corresponding circuit components are then extracted by comparing with the full-wave simulation results. The inverted-L antenna here performs not only a radiator but also the last resonator of the bandpass filter. A design procedure is given, which clearly indicates the steps from the filter specifications to the implementation. As an example, a 2.45 GHz third-order Chebyshev bandpass filter with 0.1 dB equal-ripple response is tackled. Without suffering more circuit area, the proposed structure provides good design accuracy and filter skirt selectivity as compared to the filter simple cascade with antenna and a bandpass filter of the same order. The measured results, including the return loss, total radiated power, and radiation gain versus frequency, agree well with the designed ones.},

  Abstract                 = {The fundamental and higher-order modes of a compact ring microstrip antenna are discussed. This provides insight into the functioning of this configuration. To increase its bandwidth and gain, various broadband proximity-fed configurations of a ring microstrip antenna in the 1000 MHz frequency band are proposed. A detailed explanation for the broadband behavior of all these configurations is presented. The proximity-fed square-ring antenna yielded a bandwidth of more than 250 MHz. A further increase in its bandwidth was realized by cutting a pair of rectangular slots on the edges of the ring patch. The pair of slots reduced the orthogonal TM02 mode's resonance frequency of the patch and, along with the fundamental TM10 mode, yielded a bandwidth of more than 350 MHz. Furthermore, the proximity-fed gap-coupled configurations of rectangular-slot-cut C-shaped patches, which were derived from the ring patch, are proposed. These yielded a bandwidth of more than 500 MHz (>43%). Both of these slot-cut compact configurations gave broadside radiation patterns with gains of more than 6 dBi over the bandwidth. To further increase the gain and bandwidth of the slot-cut ring antenna, a multi-resonator configuration with parasitic ring patches, gap-coupled along the two coordinate axes, is proposed. This configuration yielded a bandwidth of more than 400 MHz with a peak gain of 9 dBi. In this configuration, a further increase in the bandwidth was realized by cutting a pair of rectangular slots on the edges of the ring patches that were gap-coupled along one of the coordinate axes. This configuration gave a bandwidth of more than 500 MHz with a peak gain of 9 dBi.},

  Abstract                 = {A new Psi-shaped microstrip antenna is reported, which increased the bandwidth of the E-shaped microstrip antenna by cutting an additional pair of slots on the other radiating edge of the E-shaped patch. The Psi-shaped patch yielded a bandwidth of nearly 60% at a center frequency of around 5500 MHz. It gave a maximum gain of more than 10 dBi, which reduced to less than 4 dBi towards the higher frequencies of the bandwidth. In this paper, the broadband responses of the E-shaped and the reported.-shaped patches are studied. In the E-shaped patch, the pair of rectangular slots did not introduce any mode, but modified the TM20 mode's resonance frequency of the patch and, along with the fundamental TM01 mode, resulted in the broadband response. Furthermore, when an additional pair of slots were cut to realize the Psi-shaped patch, they modified the higher-order TM21 mode's resonance frequency of the patch. Along with the modified TM20 and TM01 modes, this yielded a larger bandwidth. Since the TM21 mode was present towards the higher frequencies of the bandwidth, the gain was reduced to less than 4 dBi. Furthermore, a proximity-fed design of a Psi-shaped microstrip antenna in the same frequency band was proposed. The proposed configuration gave a higher bandwidth compared to the reported Psi-shaped patch, with better gain characteristics over the bandwidth. A proximity-fed design of the Psi-shaped patch in the 1000 MHz frequency band was also proposed. It gave a bandwidth of more than 50% with a broadside radiation pattern, and a gain of more than 8 dBi over the complete bandwidth.},

Compared with the parasitic form with a shorted strip placed away from the main radiator in the open literature, the size of the proposed antennas can be reduced by an order of 10similar to20%, which is desirable since the size of mobile phones is becoming smaller according to consumer preferences. Moreover, the impedance matching for each band of the new antennas becomes easy. The new quad-band and five-band built-in handset antennas are developed within the limits of a 36 x 16 x 8 mm(3) volume. The antennas are also analyzed using the finite-difference time-domain technique. A good agreement is achieved between measurement and simulation.},

  Abstract                 = {{Domain decomposition methods are efficient for analyzing scattering
 problems with large-scale structures. In the present paper, an improved
 combination of Overlapped Domain Decomposition Method of Integral
 Equations (IE-ODDM) and Multilevel Fast Multi-pole Algorithm (MLFMA) is
 developed. Amount of independent MLFMA progresses of sub-domains are
 departed and re-integrated, such that the total CPU time of coupled
 effects in IE-ODDM can be saved. The proposed method developed
 minimal-completed sub-trees of sub-domains to reduce redundant
 aggregations of the MLFMA process blended in IE-ODDM. Numerical results
 and comparisons with the original method are provided, which suggest
 that the proposed combination integrates MLFMA with IE-ODDM better than
 the original combined method, and it can greatly improve the
 computational efficiency of coupled effects in IE-ODDM.}},

  Abstract                 = {The planar inverted-F antenna (PIFA) is popular for portable wireless devices because of its compact size and low profile. The PIFA is designed to operate with a ground plane and the ground plane is an integral part of the antenna assembly. In fact, the ground plane size is the limiting factor for the PIFA in many applications. Some work has been reported on the performance of PIFAs mounted on a conducting box of fixed size; however, what is lacking is a parametric study on the antenna behaviour as a function of geometry or antenna position and orientation on a finite ground plane. This paper presents results from a comprehensive investigation on the performance of a conventional PIFA mounted on ground planes of various sizes and shapes. The orientation and position of the antenna on a fixed-size ground plane is analysed. The influence of ground plane geometry on resonant frequency, bandwidth, gain, and radiation patterns are presented. These results are very useful in the design of a PIFA for applications requiring a small ground plane. Specifically, the results show the trade-offs between PIFA geometry and ground plane size with electrical performance. Both numerical simulation and experimental data are presented.},

  Abstract                 = {The purpose of this work is to propose a new method to suppress the harmonic radiation from a microstrip patch antenna with proximity coupled feeding line implemented in a multilayer substrate. The goal of the design is the suppression of the resonances at the 2nd and 3rd harmonic frequencies to reduce spurious radiation due to the corresponding patch modes to avoid the radiation of harmonic signals generated by non-linear devices at the amplifying stage. The study shows the possibility of controlling the second harmonic resonance matching by varying the length of the feeding line. On the other hand, the suppression of the third harmonic is achieved by using a compact resonator. This resonator consists of a printed metallization with a via connected to the ground plane (mushroom type) in a multilayer configuration. Comparing with conventional electromagnetically coupled patch antenna, the radiated power of the proposed antenna at the 2nd and 3rd harmonic frequencies is reduced by 14 dB and 8 dB, respectively.},

The model of the antenna incorporates the capacitive feed strip which is fed by a coaxial probe using equivalent circuit approach, and matches simulation and experimental results. The capacitive feed strip used here is basically a rectangular microstrip capacitor formed from a truncated microstrip transmission line and all its open ends are represented by terminal or edge capacitances. The error analysis was carried out for validity of the model for different design parameters. The antenna configuration can be used where unidirectional radiation patterns are required over a wide bandwidth.},

The first method, resonant frequency (ResF), utilizes the existence of the four distinct ResFs, while the second one, dimensional invariance (DI), relies on the property of DI, for the design of the U-slot microstrip patch. In both these methods, the optimization of the probe location is necessary for further enhancement of the 10-dB return loss bandwidth. The third method, dimensionally invariant ResF, that optimally combines the features of the previous two is developed here and shown to yield better bandwidth performance with minimal or no probe location optimization, and hence is superior to the other two for rapid prototyping. CMA is carried out for critical parameters, such as substrate electrical thickness, slot width, probe radius, and feed location variations, to assess their dominant influence on the characteristics of the U-slot microstrip patch antenna.},

  Abstract                 = {The simplicity and intuitive design of traditional circularly polarized (CP) patch antennas, such as the truncated corner patch antenna, has led to their widespread popularity. However, they are limited to a narrowband performance on the order of 0.1%-2% for simultaneously good and axial ratio (AR). We will prove theoretically that this is a direct result of the probe reactance hindering the use of thicker substrates to increase the bandwidth. Furthermore, we propose a novel compensation technique to enhance the bandwidth capabilities of these CP patch antennas. Our method inserts a capacitive element, such as an annular gap or parallel plate, in series with the probe inductance to remove its effect. We demonstrate this technique with simulations and measurements to obtain AR-bandwidth capabilities as high as 12.6%. To the authors' best knowledge, this is the first time that capacitive compensation and thick substrates have been jointly employed to enable broadband CP patch antennas.},

  Abstract                 = {Experimental and calculated results based on the finite-difference time-domain method are presented on the impedance and radiation characteristics of the classic shorted quarterwave patch. It is found that, for foam substrates with relative permittivity close to unity, the bandwidths of the quarterwave patches are significantly larger than the halfwave patches. On the other hand, for microwave substrates with relative permittivites equal to 2.32 and 4.0. the bandwidths of quarterwave patches are less than those of halfwave patches, owing to the excitation of surface waves. The maximum gain in the case of foam substrate is in the range of 2-3.5dBi, occurring 0-45 degrees from broadside, depending on the substrate thickness. The use of a partial short, while reducing the resonant frequency, also decreases the bandwidth. The paper also describes the application of the shorting-wall principle to realise a compact wideband L-probe patch antenna.},

The broadside gain of the filtering antenna has two poles in passband and two broadside radiation nulls (zeros) at the band edges for improving selectivity. Compared to the conventional inset-fed microstrip antenna, with a little extra circuit area, the proposed filtering antenna has a flatter passband response, better frequency skirt selectivity, and almost twice wider bandwidth.

Initially, a conventional MPA with the shorting wall is studied to demonstrate that none of the redundant modes can be excited between the dual-resonant modes. Then, a pair of shorting pins are appropriately installed underneath the patch to progressively turn up the resonant frequency of TM0,1/2 mode without significant influence on that of TM0,3/2 mode. After that, a V-shaped slot is etched out on the patch to dramatically reduce the resonant frequency of TM0,3/2 mode with little effect on that of TM0,1/2 mode. With the use of these arrangements, the dual-desired radiative resonant modes are gradually moved in proximity to each other, thus widening the impedance bandwidth under emergence of dual resonant poles. In order to validate the principle and design method, the proposed antenna is designed, fabricated, and measured. The measured results demonstrate that the impedance bandwidth of the proposed shorted patch antenna has been extended to about 11.8%, and it is about 1.82 times of 6.5% of the traditional shorted MPA. Meanwhile, the fabricated antenna exhibits other attractive performances including stable radiation pattern, same polarization, and a low-profile property with the height of 0.042 free-space wavelength.},

  Abstract                 = {{A low-profile planar inverted-F antenna (PIFA) under the operation of
 TM0,1/2 and TM2,1/2 modes in a single patch resonator for bandwidth
 enhancement is proposed. Initially, our study demonstrates that all of
 the even-order modes can effectively be suppressed by employing a
 rectangular PIFA instead of the conventional microstrip patch antenna.
 Then, a pair of shorting pins is appropriately loaded underneath the
 side-shorted radiating patch to investigate the variation of their
 odd-mode resonant frequencies. The results indicate that the resonant
 frequency of TM0,1/2 mode (f(0,1/2)) is dramatically increased up while
 almost maintaining that of TM2,1/2 mode (f(2,1/2)). After that, the
 width of the radiating patch is progressively enlarged in order to move
 the f(2,1/2) more closely to the f(0,1/2). By using this approach, the
 dual radiative resonant modes can be reallocated in proximity to each
 other. Additionally, a narrow slot is etched out on the radiating patch
 so as to counteract the equivalent inductance caused by the shorting
 pins and probe. As such, a wide-bandwidth with stable radiation pattern
 is achieved for the PIFA under the operation of these dual-resonant
 modes. After the extensive analysis is executed, the proposed antenna is
 fabricated and tested. Simulated and measured results are found in good
 agreement with each other, demonstrating that its impedance bandwidth is
 tremendously widened to about 15.3\% with appearance of two in-band
 attenuation poles. In particular, a low-profile property with the height
 of 0.036 free-space wavelength is achieved.}},

  Review                   = {In this paper, a novel low-profile planar PIFA with enhanced bandwidth is proposed under the dual-resonance operation of two radiative resonant modes, i.e., TM0,1/2 and TM2,1/2 modes. At first, all the undesired even-order modes of a rectangular MPA are removed by forming a quarter-wave patch radiator with a shorting wall, which is also called as a PIFA. After that, a pair of shorting pins is properly loaded underneath this patch, resulting to pushing up the resonant frequency of the TM0,1/2 mode. By increasing the patch width of this PIFA, the resonant frequency of the TM2,1/2 mode is moved more closely to that of the TM0,1/2 mode. Next, a narrow linear slot is cut on the patch so as to counteract the parasitic inductance of the shorting pins and feeding probe. With the reallocations of these two resonant modes in proximity to each other, a wide impedance bandwidth is attained with stable radiation pattern over the wide operating band. In final, an antenna prototype is fabricated and tested to validate the predicted performance. The results show that the bandwidth of the PIFA has gained a tremendous increment up to 15.3% with two in-band attenuation poles. Besides, a small height of about 0.036λ0 is maintained to demonstrate its low- profile property as highly demanded in all the planar antennas. Thus, the proposed wideband planar antenna with a low profile is capable of being applied to communication systems in highvelocity aircraft, missiles, and rockets.},

  Abstract                 = {A novel design concept to enhance the bandwidth of a differential-fed patch antenna using the dual-resonant radiation of a stepped-impedance resonator (SIR) is proposed. The SIR is composed of two distinctive portions: the radiating patch and a pair of open stubs. Initially, based on the transmission line model, the first and second odd-order radiative resonant modes, i.e., TM10 and TM30, of this SIR-typed patch antenna are extensively investigated. It is demonstrated that the frequency ratio between the dual-resonant modes can be fully controlled by the electrical length and the impedance ratios between the open stub and radiating patch. After that, the SIR-typed patch antenna is reshaped with stepped ground plane in order to increase the impedance ratio as highly required for wideband radiation. With this arrangement, these two radiative modes are merged with each other, resulting in a wide impedance bandwidth with a stable radiation pattern under dual-resonant radiation. Finally, the proposed antenna is designed, fabricated, and measured. It is verified in experiment that the impedance bandwidth (vertical bar Sddll vertical bar < -10 dB) of the proposed antenna has gained tremendous increment up to 10% (0.85-0.94 GHz) with two attenuation poles. Most importantly, the antenna has achieved a stable gain varying from 7.4 to 8.5 dB within the whole operating band, while keeping low-cross polarization.},

With a supporting foam substrate of thickness around 0.1 lambda(0), a rectangular patch antenna with bandwidth (SWR less than or equal to 2) of 40% and average gain of 7dBi is designed. Such wideband and high gain performance is confirmed by simulation using Ensemble. Furthermore, by introducing a second identical T-probe, which is fed out of phase with the original probe, the cross-polarisation of the H-plane is reduced substantially. The patch antenna with 2 T-shaped probes also maintains an impedance bandwidth (SWR less than or equal to 2) of 41% and average gain of 6.5dBi. Stable radiation patterns are observed across the passbands.},

At first, design and analysis of a compact wideband basic antenna which is composed of a folded-patch feed, a symmetric E-shaped edge, a U-shaped-slot patch and shorting pins are studied and investigated. The measured -10 dB impedance bandwidth of the proposed basic antenna is about 92% in the frequency range 3.94-10.65 GHz. To explicitly demonstrate the mechanism of the bandwidth enhancement method, the equivalent transmission line model of the basic antenna is exhibited. This model contributes the effect of different parts used in the basic antenna structure in order to predict the broadband behaviour of it. Moreover, with the use of a V-shaped slot instead of the U-shaped slot on the patch, an improved antenna with a wider bandwidth in order to cover the frequency range from 4 to 14.4 GHz is obtained. This improved design introduces comparatively a simpler structure with considerable size reduction and an enhancement of 21% in impedance bandwidth compared with the basic antenna. Experimental investigations and detailed simulations based on the parametric study are performed to describe and optimise the broadband performance of the proposed designs.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper introduces a new variation on the capacitive feed probe for patch antennas on thick substrates. It consists of a small circular probe-fed capacitor patch that is situated next to the resonant patch. This configuration can bring about significant savings in terms of manufacturing cost, but also lends itself to a very efficient full-wave analysis. As such, the main focus of this paper is a spectral-domain moment-method formulation, which was specifically developed for the analysis of large, but finite, arrays of these antenna elements. Entire-domain and subdomain basis functions are combined in an efficient way to minimize the computational requirements, most notably computer memory. It is shown that, for general antenna array configurations, memory savings of more than 1000 times can be achieved when compared with typical commercial software packages where only subdomain basis functions are used. A number of numerical and experimental results are also included in order to verify the spectral-domain moment-method formulation and to illustrate various applications of the new antenna element.},

To verify the design, a prototype operating at 2.4 GHz-WLAN band has been fabricated and measured. Measured reflection coefficient, axial ratio (AR), radiation pattern, and antenna gain agree well with simulation results.

  Abstract                 = {The nature of the inherent narrow bandwidth of conventional microstrip patch antennas is considered. It is observed that, except for single-feed circularly polarized elements, their bandwidth is limited only by the resonant behavior of the input impedance and not by radiation pattern or gain variations, which usually are negligible over a moderate 10 to 20% bandwidth. Therefore, broadband impedance matching is proposed as a natural to increase the bandwidth. The maximum obtainable bandwidth is calculated using Fano's broadband matching theory. It is found that by using an optimally designed impedance-matching network, the bandwidth can be increased by a factor of at least 3.9, the exact value depending on the degree of matching required. A transmission-line prototype for a proper matching network is developed. The translation of this prototype network into a practical structure (e.g. a microstrip or stripline circuit) is considered. Practical design examples and experimental results which clearly show the validity of the technique are given.},

  Abstract                 = {This tutorial presents an overview of the technological advances in millimeter-wave (mm-wave) circuit components, antennas, and propagation that will soon allow 60-GHz transceivers to provide multigigabit per second (multi-Gb/s) wireless communication data transfers in the consumer marketplace. Our goal is to help engineers understand the convergence of communications, circuits, and antennas, as the emerging world of subterahertz and terahertz wireless communications will require understanding at the intersections of these areas. This paper covers trends and recent accomplishments in a wide range of circuits and systems topics that must be understood to create massively broadband wireless communication systems of the future. In this paper, we present some evolving applications of massively broadband wireless communications, and use tables and graphs to show research progress from the literature on various radio system components, including on-chip and in-package antennas, radio-frequency (RF) power amplifiers (PAs), low-noise amplifiers (LNAs), voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs), mixers, and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). We focus primarily on silicon-based technologies, as these provide the best means of implementing very low-cost, highly integrated 60-GHz mm-wave circuits. In addition, the paper illuminates characterization techniques that are required to competently design and fabricate mm-wave devices in silicon, and illustrates effects of the 60-GHz RF propagation channel for both in-building and outdoor use. The paper concludes with an overview of the standardization and commercialization efforts for 60-GHz multi-Gb/s devices, and presents a novel way to compare the data rate versus power efficiency for future broadband devices.},

The control is achieved by placing shorting posts at appropriate locations within the antenna's boundaries. By changing the number and locations of the posts, the operating frequency can be tuned over a 1.5-to-1 range, and the polarization can be changed from horizontal to vertical, right-hand circular, or left-hand circular. All of these changes are obtained without significantly altering the input impedance or radiation patterns of the antenna and without increasing the complexity of the external microwave feed network. The frequency and polarization can be electronically controlled by using microwave switching diodes for the shorting posts. Antennas that have two feeds and operate simultaneously in two orthogonal polarizations have been constructed with the capability to switch between linear and circular polarization. Also, a thin frequency-scanned array has been built with the frequency-agile microstrip elements.},

The antenna design is comprised of three patches; a 35 degrees angularly folded patch feed (bottom patch), T-shaped patch (middle patch), and strip-loaded patch (top patch). The wide bandwidth is achieved with the integration of a 35 degrees angularly folded patch feed with a T-shaped patch. The antenna's size is reduced by using the shorting wall technique. The existence of electromagnetic coupling between the T-shaped patch and strip-loaded patch further improves the impedance bandwidth. The design exhibits a compact electrical dimension of, 0.12 lambda x 0.14 lambda x 0.08 lambda where lambda is the wavelength of the lowest operating frequency. The measured results showed that the antenna can achieve a bandwidth of 107.46% (3.1-10.3 GHz). Acceptable gain, stable radiation patterns, and low group delay variation in the operating band are achieved as well. These measured results signify the effectiveness of the proposed antenna configuration in the context of UWB application.},

  Abstract                 = {Microstrip antennas inherently have a high input impedance at resonant frequency. This may not be convenient for some applications. For active integrated antennas, moreover, the radiated power of microstrip antennas needs to be very low at harmonic frequencies. The main goals of this study are impedance matching and harmonic suppression of microstrip antennas. In order to meet these requirements, two one-dimensional (1-D) photonic bandgap (PBG) structures, namely, the defected ground structure (DGS) and the compact microstrip resonant cell (CMRC), are applied to the feed line of microstrip antennas. The characteristic impedance of the microstrip line is controlled by the additional effective inductance of the PBG structure. Without any matching circuits, microstrip antennas can be easily fed by a simple 50 &UOmega; microstrip line with a PBG structure at the operating frequency. Additionally, the second harmonic of the proposed antennas is properly suppressed compared to a conventional antenna. Measured results indicate that the two PBG structures are quite effective for harmonic suppression. Therefore, the proposed antennas are suitable for active integrated antennas.},

A double resonator equivalent circuit model is presented and used to estimate the impedance bandwidth and the respective distribution of radiation losses with typical parameter values at 900 and 1800 MHz. It is noticed that at 900 MHz, the radiation losses by the antenna element wavemode represent typically less than 10% of the total power. Thus, the antenna element works mainly as a matching element, which couples to the low-Q resonant wavemode of the chassis. At 1800 MHz, the contribution of the antenna element wavemode is larger. By enhancing the coupling and by tuning the chassis resonance, it is possible to obtain an impedance bandwidth of over 50% (6-dB return loss) at both at 900 and 1800 MHz. The results given by the equivalent circuit study are fully supported by those of three-dimensional phone-model simulations, including calculation of the SAR and efficiency values. In prototyping, the 6-dB bandwidth of 5.5% was obtained at 980 MHz with a nonradiating coupling element with a volume of 1.6 cm(3) on a 120-mm-long chassis.},

In many applications a smaller ratio is desired, and this can be achieved by introducing slots in the patch. In so doing, the ratio can be reduced to less than 1.3. For this type of antenna, a hybrid multiport theory is developed and theoretical results are found to be in excellent agreement with the measurements. As a design guide, in general, the effect of slot on the high-band frequency is stronger if it is placed where the high-order modal magnetic field is stronger; the effect of the shorting pin on the low-band frequency is stronger if it is placed where the low-order modal electric field is stronger.},

  Abstract                 = {A comprehensive study on the mechanism of bandwidth enhancement for an equilateral triangular microstrip patch antenna (MPA) under differential excitation is presented in this paper. Attributing to the way of differential excitation, the radiation directivity of TM11 mode in such a patch has been improved a lot, and field distributions for both TM10 and TM11 modes are found to be simultaneously excited for radiation. Next, two shorting posts are introduced to this MPA so as to generate an additional mode, i.e., zero mode, which resonates in a frequency between TM10 and TM11 modes. With the proper arrangement of these three modes in proximity to each other, a wide bandwidth for radiation can be satisfactorily achieved. To demonstrate the validity of the proposed concept, a prototype antenna is finally designed and fabricated. As theoretically expected, the impedance bandwidth of the final designed patch antenna has been increased to 50.46% and the gain is around 6.5 dBi. Both simulated and measured results exhibit wide bandwidth and good performance of radiation.},

This antenna structure has recently been found experimentally to provide impedance bandwidths of 10%-40%, even with nonair substrates. However, design rules for this antenna have not yet been presented. This paper develops principle design procedures through examination of the structure's multiple resonant frequencies as well as the radiation and impedance properties of different antenna geometries. The approximate design rules are derived by analysis of former experiments, method of moments (MoM) simulations, and measurement results. Simulations and measurements of several antennas designed using these new rules are presented and directions for further study are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {A monopolar patch antenna with a V-shaped slot for car-to-car (C2C) and wireless local area network (WLAN) communications is presented in this paper. To widen the impedance bandwidth of the antenna, techniques for adding a shorting pin and a V-shaped slot are applied to an equilateral triangular patch. By properly placing the shorting pins on an equilateral triangular patch, two operating modes, i.e., TM10 and TM20, are obtained. The presence of the V-shaped slot can generate an additional TM11 mode. These three resonances found in the operating frequency bandwidth resulted in a wideband characteristic. The proposed antenna can operate from 4.82 to 6.67 GHz for the reflection coefficient <=-10 dB with the gain of around 5.0 dBi. In addition, an omnidirectional radiation pattern is yielded by a coaxial center-fed probe excitation. The antenna has a thickness of 0.09 lambda(g) (at the center frequency of 5.5 GHz), which is easily hidden on the roof of a vehicle for C2C communication. This proposed design can also be used as indoor base-station antennas forWLAN communication.},

The designed results indicate that two orthogonal modes of TM10 and TM01 can be excited simultaneously in the antenna, resonate at two close frequencies, and also are matched well. Thus, a bandwidth-enhancing characteristic is achieved. The size reduction is obtained due to utilizing the slot-loading technique. Because most patch currents of the two modes flow in the same direction, the similar radiation characteristics is observed at two resonance frequencies. The significantly high cross polarization makes the proposed antenna applicable for the wireless communication in multipath environment.},

  Abstract                 = {A single-layer microstrip-fed patch antenna with capabilities of both bandwidth enhancement and harmonic suppression is proposed. For this purpose, a pair of lambda/4 microstrip-line resonators is introduced and coupled in proximity to a rectangular patch. The wideband property can be obtained by making effective use of the two resonances introduced by the radiating patch and nonradiating lambda/4 resonators. Different from other reported dual-resonance patch antennas, the proposed antenna does not require the electrically thick substrate, so it has attractive low-profile property. Thanks to the good features of lambda/4 resonators and capacitive feeding scheme, harmonic radiating modes of the patch antenna can be significantly suppressed as highly demanded in modern highly integrated communication systems. The working principle, equivalent circuit, and design procedure are extensively described. Finally, a prototype antenna operating at 4.9 GHz is designed and fabricated. The measured results show that its bandwidth is 2.7 times wider than that of the traditional insert-fed patch counterpart, and the harmful spurious radiation from other higher order radiating modes has been effectively suppressed.},

In the analysis, an equivalent circuit model is proposed to analyze and design this proposed antenna. Our investigation shows that the bandwidth of this patch can be widened by adjusting the gap between the patch and the λ/4 resonator.

  Abstract                 = {A new gain-enhanced patch antenna with loading of shorting pins is proposed in this paper. Four metallic pins are symmetrically placed in the two diagonals of a square patch resonator to electrically short the patch and ground plane. These shorting pins tremendously perturb the field distribution beneath the patch due to their shunt inductive effect. As these four pins are moved outward along the two orthogonal diagonals away from the center, their influence on the field distribution over the patch is strengthened to gradually raise its dominant mode, i.e., TM010 mode, resonant frequency as the pin-to-pin spacing is enlarged. At a fixed resonant frequency, the overall area of this proposed patch antenna with four pins results to be increased. As such, its radiation directivity or gain gets to be enhanced due to the enlarged antenna area. After extensive analysis is executed, two square patch antennas with and without loaded pins are designed and fabricated. The simulated and measured results agree with each other, and they have evidently demonstrated that the radiation directivity can be enhanced up to 11.0 dBi, or about 2.9 dB increment, by virtue of the proposed approach.},

  Abstract                 = {Rectangular patch antenna to be operated in the (0,1) and (0,3) modes is considered, since they both produce a radiation predominantly in the broadside direction (i.e. normal to the patch) and with the same polarisation. Normally, their resonant frequencies are related by a fixed ratio, approximately three (the exact value depends on the edge effect). However, theoretical consideration suggests that electrically shorting pins if placed on the nodal lines of the (0,3) modal field could have a strong effect on the (0,1) mode frequency but not on the (0,3) mode. Thus, in so doing, one achieves a design flexibility for dual-frequency rectangular patch antennas. In fact, the insertion of pins at proper locations can also be used advantageously to tune the input impedance for the (0,1) mode, while the feed location is chosen first for the desired impedance for the (0,3) mode.},
