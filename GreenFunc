  Abstract                 = {The periodic Green's functions (PGF) in layered media can be expressed as an infinite series in terms of the spectral domain Green's functions. The discrete complex image method (DCIM) can be used to approximate these spectral domain Green's functions. In this work, it is demonstrated that the complete and accurate DCIM approximation of the PGF is possible only when the DCIM approximation is obtained through the samples of the spectral domain Green's function along the real kρaxis. This choice of sampling path requires the extraction of surface wave pole contributions prior to the application of DCIM. Different forms of the Ewald method are utilized to efficiently compute the infinite summations associated with the complex images and the contribution of surface wave poles.},

  Abstract                 = {The total harmonic distortion (THD) is an important performance criterion for almost any communication device. In most cases, the THD of a periodic signal, which has been processed in some way, is either measured directly or roughly estimated numerically, while analytic methods are employed only in a limited number of simple cases. However, the knowledge of the theoretical THD may be quite important for the conception and design of the communication equipment (e.g. transmitters, power amplifiers). The aim of this paper is to present a general theoretic approach, which permits to obtain an analytic closed-form expression for the THD. It is also shown that in some cases, an approximate analytic method, having good precision and being less sophisticated, may be developed. Finally, the mathematical technique, on which the proposed method is based, is described in the appendix.},

  Abstract                 = {We implement a robust, globally convergent root search method for transcendental equations guaranteed to locate all complex roots within a specified search domain, based on Cauchy's residue theorem. Although several implementations of the argument principle already exist, ours has several advantages: it allows singularities within the search domain and branch points are not fatal to the method. Furthermore, our implementation is simple and is written in MATLAB, fulfilling the need for an easily integrated implementation which can be readily modified to accommodate the many variations of the argument principle method, each of which is suited to a different application. We apply the method to the step index fiber dispersion relation, which has become topical due to the recent proliferation of high index contrast fibers. We also find modes with permittivity as the eigenvalue, catering to recent numerical methods that expand the radiation of sources using eigenmodes.},

In this communication, an efficient and systematic method is proposed to locate all of the surface-wave poles for general multilayered structures. It is observed that the characteristic equations can be cast into a function composed of εri, kz,i, and Ti= tan(kz,idi), where the Ti occur for the substrates that have finite thicknesses. The pole location method is carried out in the complex kzM -plane, where kzM represents the wave number, along the z-axis, for the substrate with the maximum permittivity. Two sets of critical points are determined in the kzM-plane according to the parameters of the structure. Since there is at most one pole between two consecutive critical points, these critical points establish proper limits for the zero search algorithm. Muller's method can thus be applied to find the pole between the two consecutive critical points if it exists. The proposed method is validated by means of several numerical examples.},

 integrals in the context of electromagnetic scattering at particles

 relies on a lookup-table approach in combination with an asymptotic
 approximation of the Bessel function in order to enable the use of fast
 Fourier transformation. Accuracy of the algorithm is enhanced by means
 of singularity extraction and a novel technique to treat the integrand
 at small arguments. For short particle distances, this method is
 accomplished by a slower but more robust direct integration along a
 deflected contour. As an example, we investigate enhanced light
 extraction from an organic light-emitting diode by optical scattering
 particles. The calculations are discussed with respect to accuracy and
 computing time. By means of the present strategy, an accurate evaluation
 of the scattered field for several thousand wavelength scale particles
 can be achieved within a few hours on a conventional workstation

  Abstract                 = {A simple and versatile method is presented, which enhances the complex root finding process by eliminating branch cuts and branch points in the analyzed domain. For any complex function defined by a finite number of Riemann sheets, a pointwise product of all the surfaces can be obtained. Such single-valued function is free of discontinuity caused by branch cuts and branch points. The roots of the new function are the same as the roots of original multi-valued variety, while the verification of them is much easier. Such approach can significantly improve the efficiency (as well as the effectiveness) of the root finding algorithms. The validity of the presented technique is supported by the results obtained from numerical tests. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Two rational function identification techniques are examined, viz., the Sanathanan-Koerner iteration and vector fitting, and it is found that these methods generate PF models of similar quality and both provide excellent starting solutions for further improvement by nonlinear optimizers. High-quality, wide-band PF models are obtained for several metals frequently encountered in plasmonic applications. These models are stable and well-suited for the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation of light interaction with nanostructures. An efficient FDTD updating scheme for PF media is also demonstrated.},

The modal propagation constants are computed by the Cauchy integration method on the four-sheeted Riemann surface, using the derivative of the DF for greater reliability. Since analytical derivatives of the S-parameters are difficult to obtain, automatic differentiation is employed, implemented by operator overloading in modern Fortran. The method is validated using various benchmark problems found in the literature.},

 modes in the graphene layer embedded in a layered structure has been

 model results show that this configuration, depending on the frequency
 region, can support both bound and leaky surface plasmons.
 Investigation of the supporting frequency region, electromagnetic field
 distribution, and propagation length of these two modes has been
 studied. Comparison of these modes with bound modes propagated in a
 graphene layer surrounded by two semi-infinite media shows that the
 propagation characteristics are strongly affected by the coupling
 effects of a high refractive index medium in its neighbor. The leakage
 of the power into this medium results in distinct decreasing of the
 propagation length in special frequencies which depend on the
 geometrical parameters. Additionally, the radiation efficiency depends
 on the frequency and it can be modified by the structure parameters.
 This radiation can be important in designing the plasmonic devices such
 as plasmonic antennas and may be applicable for light detection of
 surface plasmon polaritons.}},

An efficient algorithm based on the contour method is proposed in this communication to locate these poles and calculate the residues. The proposed method is robust for both the lossless and lossy media. With the proposed approach, it is shown in numerical examples that some poles, very close to a branch cut, are successfully extracted in lossy media. The accurate calculation of the Green's functions in lossy layered media enables the accurate and efficient modeling of complex structures in lossy semiconductor substrates and new 3D IC structures including through-silicon vias (TSVs).},

  Abstract                 = {{A transcendental equation occurs when we compute the dispersion
 relations of an electromagnetic waveguide, such as a planar multilayer
 waveguide. Without an initial guess, the Sakurai-Sugiura projection
 method (SSM) can obtain solutions to the transcendental equation in a
 region bounded by a contour integral path in the complex plane. In this
 paper, a criterion employing the condition number of eigenvalues as a
 simple index to distinguish physical solutions from spurious ones in the
 SSM is presented, and a transcendental equation of a multilayer
 waveguide obtained by the transfer matrix method is solved by the SSM.
 Numerical results show the usefulness of the index and good agreement
 with the results of the argument principle method and Newton's method.

  Abstract                 = {Closed-form Green's functions for cylindrically stratified media are derived in terms of spherical waves and surface-wave contributions. The methodology is based on a two-level approximation of the spectral-domain Green's functions. In the first step, the large argument behavior of the zeroth-order Hankel functions is used for the extraction of the quasistatic images from the spectral-domain Green's functions with the use of the Sommerfeld identity. In the second step, the remaining part of the Green's functions are approximated in terms of pole-residue expressions via the rational function fitting method. This robust, efficient, and fully numerical approach does not call for an analytical cumbersome extraction of the surface wave poles, prior to the spectrum fitting. Moreover, it can be applied in both the near- and far-field. Numerical results for the Green's functions of one-layer and two-layer structures are presented to verify the accuracy and efficiency of this approach.},
